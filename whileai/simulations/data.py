          returns the judge report, a dict with ``graded``, ``n0``, ``n1``,
          ``backend``, ``judge_version`` and ``warnings``.
        * ``grader=``, a plain callable returning a number or
          ``{"reward": ..., "reason": ...}`` per row: scores every row in
          place over ``concurrency`` threads and returns the run itself, so
          ``data.grade(my_grader).pass_at`` reads through.
        * ``judge=``, the contract path: any callable honoring the judge
          contract, which returns
          ``{"reward": 0 or 1, "reason": str, "markers": {name: value}}``
          per row (a bare number works too). The contract
          and its failure modes are written out in full in
          ``whileai.simulations.score.judging`` (note the ``score.``; there is
          no ``whileai.simulations.judging``). It returns a ``ScoredData`` of
          copies: the trajectories here stay unmodified, judge errors are
          marked per row instead of coerced to 0, and its output feeds
          ``export_dataset`` and ``simulate(traces=...)`` directly.

        Arguments that matter:

        * ``version``: names the judge's version (model, rubric hash) and is
          recorded on every scored row; the hosted grader stamps its own.
        * ``rubric``: what doing the job means, as text, for the hosted judge;
          without it the judge grades the conduct floor only, and says so.
        * ``use_privileged``: ``True`` shows the hosted judge each row's
          ``privileged`` block (principle, reference, hidden state) the agent
          never saw.
        * ``trust``: the judge check against the rows' human labels
          (``attach_labels(kind="human")``), run on every path, with the
          summary stamped on each graded row's ``judge_meta["trust"]``.
          ``"warn"`` (the default) logs one line when the check failed or no
          labels exist, ``"require"`` raises instead, ``"off"`` skips it.
        * ``path``: write the graded run's JSONL there afterwards.
        * ``spec``: which model judges on the hosted path, as a backend spec
          (``"typesafe:jev-latest"``, ``"openai:gpt-4.1-mini"``); the same
          keyword ``grade_llm``, ``pairwise_judge`` and ``rubric_judge``
          take. ``llm_spec`` is its older name and still works.

      block (principle, reference, hidden state) the agent never saw.
