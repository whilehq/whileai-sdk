"""Row hygiene a grouped RL update or a rejection-sampling pass cares about.

Three checks, all report-first (Lambert 2025, chapters Rejection Sampling and
Synthetic Data and Distillation: dedupe and strong quality filters are what
keep synthetic data out of the collapse regime; Yu et al. 2025 (DAPO),
arXiv:2503.14476: overlong filtering; our own reward-hack scan from the RLVR
signal work: rank candidate features by correlation with reward and look at
what wins).

* ``dedupe_groups``: within one ask, rollouts that are the same
  trajectory (same behavior signature and same visible reply) add
  nothing to a group-relative advantage and, when they carry different
  rewards, are pure judge noise. Drop the repeats, keep the first.
* ``near_duplicate_prompts``: asks that are near-copies of each other
  (token-set Jaccard) weight one situation several times over. Report
  only; paraphrases are deliberate in ``mode="sft"``.
* ``length_report`` / ``reward_correlations``: rollouts that end
  mid-sentence, groups whose reply lengths are far apart, and rewards
  that track length or tool count instead of the behavior. Correlation
  above ``HACK_THRESHOLD`` is a warning, not a drop: the fix is the
  judge, not the rows.
